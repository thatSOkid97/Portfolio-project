      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, as you already know from the title my name is Siddiq, but what you don't know is that I am
        a 21 year old Sport and Exercise Science student studying at University, whilst learning to code,
        and whilst playing football, watching anime and playing PS4. What you will find below is the languages
        I've learnt. I am currently still learning on Udemy, with goals in the future to land a web developer job,
        either on the front-end or back-end or maybe even both.
      </p>

        The basics, this was the first language within the coding domain I learnt and I mean it was fun learning it at the time
        of learn it I did find some parts confusing but that is to be expected when learning something brand new.
        I can now say I am very confident in writing clear-cut HTML with no problems, understanding how it all works.
      </p>

        CSS was excited because up until this point I had just been learning html and was adding style through that,
        which of course is not ideal, but this was again another learning curve, which took some time to understand
        the syntax. However what I will say is that learning CSS where I did helped me pick up some very good programming
        habits.

      </p>

      <img src="img/Javascript.png" class="logos" alt="JavaScript logo">
      <p>
        This is a programming language that I am currently still learning with the course on Udemy, which has been the
        biggest learning curve, but has been even more fun to learn as I will soon be confident enough after I've learnt
        and understood the fundementals of JavaScript, adding logic promoting interactivity to my current and new projects.
